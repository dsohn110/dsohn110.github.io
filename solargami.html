                    <p class="mb-30">My senior capstone project was a joint collaboration project with Dr. Josh Kogot and the Naval Sea Systems 
                    Command (NAVSEA). The goal of the project was to design a 3D printer with the following requirements:
                      <ul>
                        <li>Solar Powered</li>
                        <li>Collapsible</li>
                        <li>Portable</li>
                      </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-30">Dr. Kogot and his team at NAVSEA were exploring different ways to quickly produce parts "in the field" where a reliable source
                    source of energy was not guaranteed, storage space was limited, and equipment was carried over long distances. The parts printed
                    could be used for a range of applications from drone propeller and guard components to synthetic biological lattices.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">The project started with many rounds of high level ideation. What physical form and shape would our device take?
                    What essential mechanisms would meet the requirement?</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">As those questions and sub-questions started getting addressed, our team began developing prototypes to bring
                    ideas in our head to physcial and tangible objects. When holding the first physical models, more clarity and direction on where
                    to take the project arose. Accordingly, the challenges that we would face and need to address also became clearer as we moved forward.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">The first phase of prototyping started with exploring different types of 3D printers. In today's day and age,
                    there is a plethora, from resin based printers, traditional PLA/ABS printers, XYZ-Axis actuation, and Delta/Polar Coordinate systems
                    to name a few. In order to incorporate the "portability" and "collapsibility" features our team also explored other machines in the
                    world that also do these things. Construction Cranes interestingly became a big influence in their ability to handle torque and dynamic movement
                    along with it's own assembly and transport between construction sites. With this idea we built some prototypes:</p>

                    <img src="images/projects/solargami/prototype1.jpg" width="340" height="240">

                     <p class="mb-30">With our first prototype showing promise, the team continued to refine the design. We implemented better
                     support structures, a new plastic extruder, and better folding mechanisms. We were also now moving from having individual
                     software to manually control motors to integration with open source 3D printer communication software. It was the coolest
                     feeling to finally see the ideas and concepts come to life and perform:</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">By the end of this 6 month journey, our team went from whiteboard ideas and napkin sketches to a full functioning
                    prototype that printed out our first object. It's always crazy and amazing to look back on the journey of buidling something from 
                    concept to creation. You remember the late nights turning into early mornings, the struggle of failed prototypes, but at the end
                    it's really cool to see something you and your team worked hard on finally come to fruition.</p>
