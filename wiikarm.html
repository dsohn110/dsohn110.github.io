                    <p class="mb-30">During my Junior Year of college, I took a course on Mechatronics. This was probably my favorite engineering course I took 
                    because it was finally something <strong>hands on</strong>. As a mechanical engineer, it's kind of a dream to be able to
                    actually make something tangible. Even better, something that moves! Isn't that kind of the whole reason someone does MechE?
                    This course was awesome! I learned in depth how microcontrollers work, how different motors function, and how different sensors 
                    communicate. And beyond the pencil paper learning, this was the first "lab" class that I actually looked forward too (RIP Chem Lab).
                    We learned how to program the Arduino, build circuits, and use everything from simple LEDs lighting up to controlling motors.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">At the end of the semester, we had a final project where we use what learned throughout the course and make our own
                    project. We were encouraged to go beyond what we learned and make something challenging. <strong>Being a baller on a budget</strong>
                    I had to be creative with resources I already, because I didn't have $100 to drop on more parts. Combined with my interest in robots,
                    I decided to make a robot arm that is controlled by a Nintendo Wii Nunchuck. How hard could it be?</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-30">This is where I learned (the hard way) that parts ordered online don't always have "2-day Prime Shipping" and that
                    just because I have the plan in my head or even on paper, doesn't mean that when the parts come in, that everything is going to assemble
                    perfectly like Ikea furniture.</p>

                    <p class="mb-30">So by now you're probably wondering why I called this project "Wiik Arm". That's because my robot arm was indeed very wiik.
                    The driver circuits I ordered to help control the two main stepper motors (bearing the most torque), unfortunately were faulty. I was in panic mode
                    since the project was due in a few days and there was no way with shipping times, I was going to be able to get new parts. Scrambling around, I 
                    managed to find two H-Bridges that would just possibly work. And in the end, althouhg they couldn't draw the ideal amount of current, making
                    my robot arm a wiik arm, it was still able to work and that was pretty cool to see.</p>

                      Mistakes I made:
                      <ul> 
                        <li>Not ordering multiple parts (because Murphy's Law is undefeated)</li>
                        <li>Create realistic scope (because it always seems easier on paper)</li>
                      </ul>
                      <br>
                      Skills I developed and used:

                        <li>Sensors and Motors (accelerometers, stepper motors, and servo motors)</li>
